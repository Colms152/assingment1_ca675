<p>When someone using a browser (or firefox with noscript) without javascript the div simply remains invisible. The problem with this is that I do not want the content to be inaccessible. I also do not want to leave the div visible then use the script to make it transparent as the div is located at the bottom of the document and it causes a noticeable flicker whenever a page loads.</p>

<p>I have tried using noscript tags to embed an additional style sheet that is only loaded for people without the luxury of Javascript but this fails the XHTML strict validation. Is there any other way to include extra styling information inside a noscript block that is XHTML valid?</p>

<p>The content is of variable height, and the content scrollbar must be show in the page body (and not on it's on area).
I managed to get the basic idea, but I'm having trouble to getting the content div in it's correct position when the scrollbar shows, and even if I set to always show the scrollbars, I can't use a fixed width because they differ from browser to browser.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""position:absolute; background-color:Transparent; left:0px; right:0px; height:100px; z-index:2;""&gt;

        Header
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Fixed div acting as the body ""page"" so the scrollbar shows as the page's --&gt;

            Content
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=""position:absolute; left:50%; right:0px; padding-top:100px; z-index:0;""&gt;
